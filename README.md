# Tokenized Decentralized Outdoor Thermometer Networks

A blockchain-based system for managing distributed outdoor thermometer networks with tokenized incentives, data accuracy verification, and community-driven maintenance.

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized network of outdoor thermometers that collect, validate, and share weather data across neighborhoods. The system uses tokenization to incentivize accurate data collection, proper maintenance, and community participation.

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Accuracy Calibration Contract (`accuracy-calibration.clar`)
- Ensures temperature reading precision and reliability
- Validates sensor accuracy against reference standards
- Manages calibration schedules and verification processes
- Rewards accurate sensors and penalizes inaccurate ones

### 2. Weather Station Contract (`weather-station.clar`)
- Coordinates neighborhood climate data collection
- Registers and manages thermometer stations
- Handles data submission and validation
- Tracks station performance metrics

### 3. Maintenance Service Contract (`maintenance-service.clar`)
- Handles cleaning and calibration procedures
- Schedules maintenance tasks
- Tracks service provider performance
- Manages maintenance rewards and penalties

### 4. Data Sharing Contract (`data-sharing.clar`)
- Facilitates community weather information exchange
- Manages data access permissions
- Handles data monetization and rewards
- Ensures data privacy and security

### 5. Replacement Tracking Contract (`replacement-tracking.clar`)
- Manages thermometer upgrade and substitution
- Tracks device lifecycle and warranty
- Handles replacement scheduling and logistics
- Manages upgrade incentives

## Features

- **Tokenized Incentives**: Earn tokens for accurate data, proper maintenance, and community participation
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decision making for network parameters
- **Data Accuracy**: Multi-layer validation ensures reliable temperature readings
- **Maintenance Tracking**: Automated scheduling and verification of device maintenance
- **Upgrade Management**: Seamless device replacement and upgrade processes

## Token Economics

- **Data Rewards**: Tokens earned for submitting accurate temperature data
- **Maintenance Rewards**: Tokens for performing verified maintenance tasks
- **Accuracy Bonuses**: Additional rewards for consistently accurate sensors
- **Governance Tokens**: Voting rights for network parameter changes

## Getting Started

1. Deploy the smart contracts to the Stacks blockchain
2. Register your thermometer station
3. Begin submitting temperature data
4. Participate in maintenance and calibration activities
5. Earn tokens and contribute to community weather data

## Network Participation

### For Thermometer Owners
- Register your device with the weather station contract
- Submit regular temperature readings
- Maintain your device according to schedule
- Earn tokens for accurate and timely data

### For Maintenance Providers
- Register as a service provider
- Accept maintenance tasks in your area
- Complete calibration and cleaning procedures
- Earn tokens for verified maintenance work

### For Data Consumers
- Access community weather data
- Purchase premium data access
- Contribute to data validation
- Participate in network governance

## Technical Architecture

The system consists of five interconnected smart contracts that work together to create a robust, decentralized weather monitoring network. Each contract handles specific aspects of the network while maintaining data integrity and incentive alignment.

## Security Considerations

- All contracts implement proper access controls
- Data validation prevents malicious submissions
- Token economics discourage gaming the system
- Regular audits ensure contract security

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with IoT devices for automated data collection
- Machine learning models for data validation
- Cross-chain compatibility for broader adoption
- Mobile applications for easy network participation
